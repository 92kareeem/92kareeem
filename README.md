Hi, I’m Syed Abdul Kareem Ahmed
I’m a Computer Science (AI & ML) graduate and an AI/ML Engineer passionate about building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems. I’m currently working as a Software Developer Intern at IIIT-Hyderabad Research Center (IHub-Data) and have previously interned with ML/AI teams where I contributed to production-grade solutions.

My open-source work spans machine learning, deep learning, full-stack applications, and AI-driven automation, where I focus on scalable and practical implementations — from predictive systems to autonomous agent frameworks.
